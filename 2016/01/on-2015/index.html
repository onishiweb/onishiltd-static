<h1>On 2015</h1>
<p class="byline">
Posted on <time>3rd January, 2016</time>, in <a href="category/personal/" rel="category tag">Personal</a> </p>
</header>
<p>I haven&#8217;t done much looking back over the last couple of years. I took a look through my posting history and my <a href="2013/01/on-2012-the-year-of-all-the-things/">last retrospective post</a> was looking back to 2012. This past year has been quite impactful though so I wanted to take a brief look back over my working and personal life in the last year, while looking ahead to what some of my goals are ahead of the coming year too.</p>
<h2>Stats</h2>
<p>Let&#8217;s start off on a positive note, this year I have:</p>
<ul>
<li>Spoken at 14 conferences and meetups</li>
<li>Travelled to 6 different countries &#8211; 4 for the first time</li>
<li>Wrote 5 blog posts</li>
<li>Relaunched 12 Devs of Xmas</li>
<li>Completed 3 cycling sportives, totalling 240+ miles</li>
<li>Lost 10Kg</li>
</ul>
<p>It&#8217;s definitely been a year of speaking for me, and I&#8217;ve been lucky enough to speak at some amazing conferences. From the likes of <a href="http://2015.webdevconf.com/">Web Dev Conf</a> a conference I&#8217;ve been a fan of for the past few years, through to <a href="http://conferences.oreilly.com/velocity/devops-web-performance-eu-2015">Velocity Conf</a> which is one of the biggest devops and performance conferences in the world it&#8217;s been a great experience. Throughout the year I gave variations on three different talks I&#8217;d been working on, which doesn&#8217;t sound like very many compared to the number of conferences but allowed me to refine and improve those talks throughout the year.</p>
<p>I travelled a bit as well, and not just because of conferences thankfully. My girlfriend (Margarida) and I took a short break to Dublin earlier in the year, before later flying over to Portugal to meet her family for the first time in the Autumn. I really enjoy travelling and experiencing new places, however it&#8217;s quite something else when you go somewhere where you no longer speak the native language and are thrown in the deep end by meeting friends and family that don&#8217;t speak your language very much either. While it has the makings of an awkward time, with a bit of effort from both sides, it really is amazing how much of a difference it makes when experiencing a new place.</p>
<h2>Bad and good times</h2>
<p>On a personal note, this year has had it&#8217;s moments of great happiness and great sadness. In June, my Nan passed away. It was a really tough time for me and the rest of the family, she was an amazing woman who I learned an awful lot from over the years. I&#8217;m very happy I was able to <a href="2015/06/yesterday/">share some of the great memories</a> we have of her at the funeral, sharing some very happy memories at such a sad time.</p>
<p>There were also some very good times this year as well. After more than a year together, Margarida and I decided the time was right to move in together. We have been very lucky to find an amazing flat in South London together and moved in in November. It&#8217;s a great feeling being able to share that bit more with each other now and I&#8217;m looking forward to even more time together now. Although we could do with a bit more storage space! For two people that have been living in two small rooms for the past couple of years, we have a heck of a lot of stuff.</p>
<p>Also in 2015, I had my &#8220;Harajuku Moment&#8221;, where I realised it was finally time to put some effort into losing weight. While at that moment it was a pretty horrible feeling, the resulting diet and exercise has seen me lose a lot more weight and visible size than I thought possible when I started. Although it&#8217;s <a href="2015/11/dieting-and-meetups/">not been easy at times</a>. It&#8217;s only a start, I took a break necessary break over Christmas and I&#8217;ve gone backwards a bit in terms of weight loss, but I&#8217;m committed to getting back on the diet soon and working hard to get my weight down even further this year.</p>
<h2>I took on too much again&#8230;</h2>
<p>I guess what&#8217;s prompted this post is a realisation that I&#8217;ve done it again and taken on too much work and committed to too many things over the past year &#8211; and into this year as well. I&#8217;ve been trying to work out if this is a character trait of mine that I just feel like I need to be busy all the time, or whether it&#8217;s a cause of boredom or something else. There are some changes coming up for 2016 which I&#8217;m looking forward to and hoping by making them that I&#8217;ll be able to take on less and concentrate on fewer but more enjoyable goals.</p>
<p>Looking ahead to 2016, I&#8217;m making a concerted effort to not do as much outside of work. I&#8217;m going to be finishing the freelance projects that I have and then not taking on any more after that. It will make saving a bit harder but this year I&#8217;ve overworked myself again which has resulted in neglecting the few clients that I do have and I would prefer to avoid that in the future. I&#8217;m also going to be putting myself forward for less speaking this year, I still want to do some, but I won&#8217;t be putting out 10s of proposal like I have in the past year. It&#8217;s a great feeling to be accepted to speak at so many but again by taking on the number that I did I felt like I wasn&#8217;t able to give the time to each one as I should have.</p>
<p>Bringing back <a href="http://12devsofxmas.co.uk">12 Devs of Xmas</a> has been both fantastic and stressful at the same time. The Xmas period is quite stressful enough without having to make sure we&#8217;re ready to post an article a day starting at midnight on Boxing Day! But it&#8217;s also fun and we have some great articles again this year which makes it all worthwhile. I&#8217;m just glad we decided after not having it sorted before November that a redesign just wasn&#8217;t on the cards, but that&#8217;ll be a fun thing for next year.</p>
<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>I&#8217;ve never been one for New Year&#8217;s resolutions, but this year I do have some goals that I am going to work towards and just hope to feel like I&#8217;ve accomplished somewhat at this time next year. So my goals this year are simple.</p>
<p>Do less work, spend more time with my family, friends, and most importantly my girlfriend. To work on more personal side projects, and not feel stressed with letting people down if I don&#8217;t get round to them. And to continue to focus on my health and lose weight, I would really like to get down to at least under 100Kg this year. Maybe then I&#8217;ll have a haircut and shave off the beard!</p>
