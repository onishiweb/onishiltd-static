<h1>What a great weekend!</h1>
<p class="byline">
Posted on <time>7th September, 2011</time>, in <a href="category/personal/" rel="category tag">Personal</a> </p>
</header>
<p>Hi again, just a quick one this time to mention all the amazing extra stuff that happened at Update 2011 and to say hello and thank you to all the exceptionally interesting, entertaining and hilarious people I was lucky enough to meet over the course of 2 nights and 2 days.</p>
<p>The first person I&#8217;ll mention is Paul King (<a title="Paul King" href="http://twitter.com/nrocy">@nrocy</a>) who I&#8217;ve been speaking to on Twitter for a while now but had never met until Sunday before the Royal Banquet, we spent most of the evening drinking and talking with him telling me about the wonders of freelancing, Arduino and just tinkering with anything and everything you can get your hands on. During the banquet I also was lucky enough to be sat at the same table as Drew McCormack (<a title="Drew McCormack" href="http://twitter.com/drewmccormack">@drewmccormack</a>) who would be teaching me the wonders of Core Animation in his workshop on the Tuesday. That evening we ended up back in the My Hotel bar drinking Long Island Ice Teas and talking with (and hugging) lots of great people who were either attending or helping out at the conference, one of those being the lovely Jana Lyon (<a href="http://twitter.com/Jana_lyon">@Jana_lyon</a>).</p>
<p>The conference day bought more introductions to some (admittedly more sober) people, one of which was Syd Lawrence (<a href="http://twitter.com/sydlawrence">@sydlawrence</a>) who quite scarily came up to me pointing and asking &#8220;Adam?&#8221;, I&#8217;m still not used to the fact people can recognise you just from your activity on Twitter. Spent a lot of the conference day and evening in the company of Syd and am sorely tempted to buy a ticket to see him speak at Heart &amp; Sole in Portsmouth. I also had the pleasure of Aral coming up to me during pre-conference coffees and pointing out that I looked as if I&#8217;d had a long night, thanks sir, thanks a lot!</p>
<p>The conference day went brilliantly and you can read more on that in my review of <a title="Let the sunshine in – Update Conference 2011" href="http://www.onishiweb.co.uk/2011/09/let-the-sunshine-in-update-conference-2011/">Update 2011</a>.</p>
<p>As always a great conference should have a great after party and as I mentioned before Update didn&#8217;t let us down, A Night in a Museum was a fantastic way to end the day. Not only was it a great venue but it offered what a lot of clubs aren&#8217;t able to, a place to talk without overpowering music as well as great conversation pieces with the art and exhibitions all around us. I was also lucky enough to bump into Anna Debenham wandering around looking at things and she was nice enough to talk with me about the work she does and how I can get involved &#8211; I&#8217;ve today signed up to be a STEM ambassador and also mentioned to a friend of mine who teaches in a secondary school about getting out into schools myself and talking about the work I do.</p>
<p>I met tons of people there at the museum and I apologise if I miss any names but the few I can remember are Rosie Clarke (<a href="http://twitter.com/rosieclarke">@rosieclarke</a>) talking about gothic/bondage clothing; Alice Reeves (<a href="http://twitter.com/Alice_reeves">@Alice_reeves</a>) chatting copywriting and cake; Nick Charlton (<a href="http://twitter.com/nickcharlton">@nickcharlton</a>) talking of work placements and iOS dev; Linda Sandvik (<a href="http://twitter.com/hyper_linda">@hyper_linda</a>) she&#8217;s not the only dev in the village (I hate that show but I couldn&#8217;t resist the line); as well as Rowan Merewood (<a href="http://twitter.com/rowan_m">@rowan_m</a>) and Ben Longden (<a href="http://twitter.com/blongden">@blongden</a>) who I spent a lot of time drinking with throughout that evening (more on that later). Again apologies if I&#8217;ve missed anyone it was a bit mental, I mean I even got to shake hands with a true legend, Mr Ronal Wayne.</p>
<p>Again after that we ended up back at the My Hotel bar with plenty of speakers, attendees and Update team members where we continued the drinking and chatting, this included an incident with Linda Sandvik&#8217;s longboard which resulted in me getting bought a lovely double Jack Daniel&#8217;s Single Barrel by a very apologetic Paul King! He got his comeuppance however as he himself was victim to a longboard attack which resulted in him with a lot more physical damage than he gave me.</p>
<p>We also became very good friends with some of the Update team members Clare Sutcliffe (<a href="http://twitter.com/ClareSutcliffe">@ClareSutcliffe</a>), Ruth Harper (<a href="http://twitter.com/ruharper">@ruharper</a>) and the unforgettable (with her fantastic inability to blink) Thea Kearse (<a href="http://twitter.com/theakearse">@theakearse</a>) after we bought them a bottle of wine as a thank you for all they&#8217;re hard work.</p>
<p>Myself, Ruth, Thea, Rowan and Ben eventually ended up heading for some food (and more alcohol of course) at Buddies on the seafront at 3am. I can honestly say I&#8217;ve never laughed so hard in my life thanks to that evening, I thought watching a grown man fall off his chair onto the floor whilst trying to steal a mouthful of Spaghetti Carbonara was funny enough, however seeing the pictures of it happen frame by frame made me actually cry with laughter. After a great night I finally managed to get back to the hotel for a few hours sleep before I had to head over to Lighthouse Arts for a Core Animation workshop with Drew.</p>
<p>Again throughout the day I managed to meet some really interesting people but as I was in poor condition after the lack of sleep can only remember the name of one of those so please please please if I did meet you on Tuesday during the workshop say hi as I would really like to keep in touch with what everyone is doing.</p>
<p>So that was actually pretty long, oops, and it&#8217;s nearly time for Franklin and Bash so I&#8217;m going to stop hear and once again say that if I did meet you and I haven&#8217;t mentioned you here or followed you on Twitter please get in touch as it&#8217;s not rudeness it&#8217;s purely embarrassment at forgotten names.</p>
<p>Night all</p>
