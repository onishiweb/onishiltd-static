<h1>20 seconds is not long at all</h1>
<p class="byline">
Posted on <time>5th June, 2011</time>, in <a href="category/speaking/" rel="category tag">Speaking</a> </p>
</header>
<p>I&#8217;ve been wanting to venture into public speaking for some time now and recently thanks to Science Oxford Live&#8217;s PechaKucha night I was giving an opportunity to break my public speaking cherry as it were.</p>
<h2>PechaKucha</h2>
<p>PechaKucha is a presentation style devised in Japan. Based on a simple concept of 20 images, 20 seconds for each. It keeps the presentation going quickly, very quickly as I found out. You can go to <a href=" //www.pecha-kucha.org/">pecha-kucha.org</a> for more details and to see some examples.</p>
<p>This was the second PechaKucha night Science Oxford had put on and seeing @iblamefish speak at the last one I thought I&#8217;d give it a try as a bit of an entry-point into public speaking. The call for talks was quite generic and a relation to science would be a bonus, so I went for something I&#8217;m pretty passionate about and got lucky as the link to science is rather strong. I&#8217;ve been interested in Formula One for as long as I can remember and as the sport is constantly pushing the boundaries of science to go as quick as possible I thought it was a good choice.</p>
<p>So with topic decided I needed to do a little bit more research and try and get together a presentation on the science bits behind the fastest sport on 4 wheels! So with a couple of months to prepare I did what would make the past student part of me proud, I put it off until the week before the night itself.</p>
<h2>The night</h2>
<p>The night of the talk I think I&#8217;d ran through it maybe once completely after overrunning on the first 3 slides about 5 times, turns out that 20 seconds really isn&#8217;t that long after all. I planned about 3-4 sentences per photo and it seemed I could barely get through 2 :/ so basically what that taught me is that I should really plan a talk a little further in advance to give myself a little longer to test it out, rookie mistake.</p>
<p>After finally getting over to Science Oxford and getting the slides loaded up on the computer I waited around with the hosts and a couple of other speakers for things to begin. When we got settled down for the talks to begin I actually had no idea in which order the talks were going in apart from a cursory glance at a list which had me in 4th, turns out I was second!</p>
<p>The talk went, well, quickly&#8230;it seemed that no longer had I got up there I was pretty much sitting back down again. A couple of things I did notice while I was speaking was that I mainly spoke to one person in the audience (the guy pretty much straight in front of me) and even though I had notes for each slide I managed mostly not to look at them as I just reeled off the first things I could remember for that slide as I was extremely aware of small amount of time I had.</p>
<h2>The result</h2>
<p>Afterwards there were a couple of questions, one being do I have any involvement with F1 and am I paid to do this sort of thing, the very short answer to that was &#8216;no&#8217; unfortunately you don&#8217;t have to pay me to talk about F1 but if anybody would like to I&#8217;ll happily accept!</p>
<p>All in all I&#8217;m pretty happy with how things went, I could have done more prep and maybe given myself some more time to run through it some more and make adjustments but as a first go it wasn&#8217;t too bad. And the whole speaking in front of strangers wasn&#8217;t as bad as I thought and I would happily do it again. I was speaking to one of the other speakers at the end of the night who asked if I would do the presentation again for kids which would be an experience I guess but why not&#8230;</p>
